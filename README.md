# GoZilla_Finance_App

Group project for Mobile App Development, CS5220, Northeastern University.
This is an apk for Android device. It is the beginnings of a financial app to keep track of personal expenses, budgeting, stock prices, learning about finance, and a news feed. We collectively designed the different features using 'paper prototyping'. I personally designed the News Feed function and pair-coded the multiple-choice question learning feature. This project represents my first attempt at coding for an Android mobile device.
