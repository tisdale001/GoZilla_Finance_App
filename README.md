## Background
This was a group project for Mobile App Development, CS5520, Northeastern University. Contained here is the apk for Android device. It is the beginnings of a financial app to keep track of personal expenses, budgeting, stock prices, learning about finance, and a news feed. We collectively designed the different features using 'paper prototyping'. I personally designed the News Feed function and pair-coded the multiple-choice question learning feature. This project represents my first attempt at coding for an Android mobile device.
## Features of Project:
* Login and Sign Up for Users using firebase database
* Forgot password feature
* Logout Feature
* Verify email address feature
* Personalized dashboard
* Expense Tracking in total expenses where user can set the expenses for individual items and then track their expenses
* Api to fetch, parse and display complex JSON data and display latest news related to business, stocks, funds, etc.
* Used Jira for managing the team progress: AGILE approach
## Installation
Download the apk onto an Android Device(phone).
